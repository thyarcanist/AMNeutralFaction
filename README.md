# AMNeutralFaction
Script that sets you neutral to raiders and teammates in Fallout New Vegas, it's mainly for the New California mod but it should also work for normal Fallout: NV as well.

I haven't added the item to a box in goodsprings; but it works and has been tested. Can use it as an disguise to wander the wasteland freely without being hit by another enemy. You'd need to add it in. This mod is for so you can disguise yourself as a Raider after the prolouge with a special outfit. Due to some reasons, as well as myself starting school when I was adding to the mod project: I wasn't able to go around and actually make the dialouge edits that would reflect that and have it fully integrated.

Haven't added the item to a box in goodsprings yet; but it works and has been tested. Can use it as an disguise to wander the wasteland freely without being hit by another enemy. You'd need to add it in. This mod is for so you can disguise yourself as a Raider after the prolouge with a special outfit. Due to some reasons, with me starting school and such: I wasn't able to go around and actually make the dialouge edits that would reflect that.

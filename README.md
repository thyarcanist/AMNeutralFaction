# AMNeutralFaction
Script that sets you neutral to raiders and teammates in Fallout New Vegas. In the New California mod.

Haven't added the item to a box in goodsprings yet; but it works and has been tested. Can use it as an disguise to wander the wasteland freely without being hit by another enemy.
